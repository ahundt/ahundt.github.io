## PhD, Johns Hopkins University

My goal is to create robots and other learning agents with brilliant adaptability, skillsets, and capabilities that are tailored to respect human Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).

## Democratizing Access: Natural Cooperation between Diverse Human Populations and Learning Agents

I'm [Computing Innovation Fellow](https://cifellows2021.org/2021-class/) with the Computing Research Association (CRA) under National Science Foundation (NSF) support, for a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Georgia Institute of Technology with Assistant Professor Matthew Gombolay and Regents' Professor Ronald C. Arkin.

Our objective is to develop human and technical principles, processes, metrics, and algorithms that advance Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the development of computational methods for Robotics and AI.
