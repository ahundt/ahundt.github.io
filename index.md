## About

I am a Computing Innovation Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University with a PhD from Johns Hopkins University.

My goal is to create robots and learning agents with exceptional adaptability and capabilities that respect human Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.

**[Love, Joy, and Autism Robots: A Metareview and Provocatype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05098)** - A3DE workshop @ HRI 2024

Examines how autism research in robotics has prioritized interventions aimed at conforming neurodivergent individuals to neurotypical norms, rather than centering their own experiences and needs.

Reviews James Adrian Wright's ethnography "Robots Won't Save Japan," examining elder care robotics and augmenting insights with overlooked perspectives from Disability and Robotics research.

### 2023

**[Anti-ableist language is fully compatible with high-quality autism research: Response to Singer et al.(2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aur.2928)** - Autism Research 2023

**[Towards Equitable Agile Research and Development of AI and Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08242)** - WeRobot 2023 / arXiv 2024

Proposes adapting Agile/Scrum R&D methodologies to build organizational equity capabilities and integrate evidence-based fairness practices in AI and robotics development.

### 2022

**[Robots Enact Malignant Stereotypes](https://sites.google.com/view/robots-enact-stereotypes/home)** - FAccT '22 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533138))

Evaluates how ML bias manifests in robots that physically act in the world, showing that CLIP-powered robotic manipulation methods enact toxic stereotypes with respect to gender, race, and scientifically-discredited physiognomy.
