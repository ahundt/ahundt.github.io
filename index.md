### PhD Student, Johns Hopkins University

I'm interested in the intersection of Deep Learning, Neural Architecture Search, and Robotics.

#### Selection of Papers

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N0JJHwkAAAAJ) page for the complete and up to date list because this page is not updated frequently.

[SharpDARTS: Faster and More Accurate Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09900) Preprint 2019
Sets state of the art (SOTA) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and matches SOTA on ImageNet at mobile	scale in March 2019. Proposes Differentiable Hyperparameter Search and Cosine Power Annealing.

**[The CoSTAR Block Stacking Dataset: Learning with Workspace Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11714)** IROS 2019

A dynamic robotics dataset which serves as a valuable resource to researchers across a broad range of topics. Proposes HyperTree Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for refining neural network models.

### Personal Projects

#### [Boost.Container static_vector](http://is.gd/BoostSV)

Part of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://boost.org), `static_vector`, aka `varray`, is a sequence container like `std::vector` with the benefits of statically allocated storage as found in `std::array`. **Acknowledgments**: [Boost.Geometry](http://is.gd/geometryack), [Boost.Container](http://is.gd/containerack)

#### [CalcHundter](CalcHundter)

A cross-platform calculator app to assist with programming arithmetic and bit operations, made with the use of HCI research and design principles. **Download**: [Windows](http://is.gd/calchundterwin), [Mac](http://is.gd/calchundtermac)

#### [Wii Remote Controlled Robot](http://youtu.be/jPCQyqeU0kw)

In 2007 I built a robot that can be controlled by Wii remote.

#### [CMU Buggy](http://is.gd/cmubuggy)

I was an engineer for Fringe Racing, a team which designs and builds human powered, ultra light carbon composite vehicles. Fringe Racing placed first in the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Design Competition in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Elected Chairman of the Sweepstakes Committee for 2009; led the school wide organization with 13 teams and 250 members.

#### Inertial Electrostatic Confinement fusion reactor

In High School I researched an Inertial Electrostatic Confinement fusion reactor which achieved plasma.
